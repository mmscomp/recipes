Ingredients:

3 cups mixed beans (kidney beans, black-eyed beans, chickpeas, soya beans, mung beans, green beans, black beans, white beans)
1 teaspoon jwanu (lovage seeds)
1 teaspoon fennel seeds
1 teaspoon mustard seeds
1 tablespoon cumin powder
1 tablespoon coriander powder
1 tablespoon garlic, minced
1 tablespoon ginger, minced
3 fresh red chilies, minced
½ teaspoon turmeric
1 teaspoon freshly ground pepper
1 cup chopped tomatoes
2 cups yogurt
4 cups vegetable broth
3 tablespoons mustard oil
Salt to taste
2 tablespoons green onion, finely chopped for garnish

Directions:

In a large bowl with water soak beans overnight. Drain the water, wash the beans. Cover the bowl and set it in a warm place to allow sprouting. It takes about 2-3 days depending on the desired length of sprouts. To cook, heat oil in a saucepan. Fry jwanu, fennel seeds, and mustard seeds until light brown. Add 3 cups of sprouted beans and fry for 2 min. under medium heat. Add chili, cumin, coriander, garlic, ginger, turmeric, salt, and pepper. Mix to coat the sprouted beans well, for about 2 min. Add tomatoes, broth and yogurt to the beans’ mixture. Bring to a boil and let simmer in low heat until the sprouts are tender and the desired consistency of the soup has been achieved. Garnish with chopped green onions.

Serve with rice.
